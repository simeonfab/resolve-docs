# Resolve Output Templates — Master Definitions (v1)
Generated: 2 July 2026
Author: Strategic Product Director framing
Status: v1 working definitions, not final copy

---

## How these work

Each template has:
- **ID** — used by the frontend to know how to render/generate it
- **Label pattern** — dynamic, project-specific. Never generic.
- **When to surface** — when Call 2 should select this template for a given project
- **Content shape** — what the output actually contains
- **Tone** — how it should feel

Call 2 selects the 6 most relevant templates for each project and returns them with project-specific label and description text. The frontend renders whatever 6 come back.

---

## Template 01 — Key Decision

**ID:** `key-decision`

**Label pattern:** "Decide: [the specific decision]"
Example: "Decide: which brand name to go with"
Example: "Decide: whether to build or validate first"

**When to surface:** when the project has a clear decision that is blocking meaningful progress. Specifically: when the recommended action depends on a choice not yet made.

**Content shape:**
- The decision in one sentence
- Why it's blocking (one sentence)
- 2–3 realistic options, each with a one-line trade-off
- A suggested lean if one is clearly stronger (optional, only if genuinely supportable from input)

**Tone:** Direct. Not wishy-washy. Gives the user a real steer if one exists.

---

## Template 02 — One-Week Action Plan

**ID:** `one-week-plan`

**Label pattern:** "Your plan for this week"
(stays relatively consistent — the specificity is in the content, not the label)

**When to surface:** almost always. Default inclusion unless the project is so early-stage that even a week plan would be invented.

**Content shape:**
- 3 specific actions for this week
- Each with: what to do, done-when condition, rough timebox
- Ordered by sequence (not importance — what to do first, second, third)

**Tone:** Concrete and achievable. Not aspirational. If it can't be done in a week, it shouldn't be on this list.

---

## Template 03 — Continue in AI

**ID:** `ai-continuation`

**Label pattern:** "Continue this in [tool]" if tool detected, otherwise "Pick this up in Claude / ChatGPT"

**When to surface:** always. One of the core handoff outputs. Should almost always be in the default six.

**Content shape:**
A ready-to-paste prompt that includes:
- Full project context summary (what the project is, current state, what's been decided)
- What was recommended and why
- What the user should ask the AI to help with next
- Any open questions or decisions still outstanding

Formatted so the user can literally copy and paste it into another AI tool and continue immediately.

**Tone:** Functional. This isn't a document, it's a prompt. Should feel like a baton handoff.

---

## Template 04 — Plain English Explanation

**ID:** `plain-english`

**Label pattern:** "Explain [project name or 'this'] to someone else"

**When to surface:** almost always. Especially when the project description in the input was complex, technical, or hard to summarise.

**Content shape:**
One paragraph (4–6 sentences) that explains:
- What this project is
- Why it matters / what problem it solves
- Where it currently stands
- What's happening next

Written for someone with no prior knowledge of the project. Jargon-free.

**Tone:** Warm, clear, human. Written as if explaining to a smart friend who doesn't work in the same field.

---

## Template 05 — Share Message

**ID:** `share-message`

**Label pattern:** "Send this to someone"

**When to surface:** when the project owner appears to need external support, investment, collaboration, or just to explain the project to someone in their life. Surface alongside or instead of plain-english depending on context — these are variants of the same need.

**Content shape:**
2–3 sentences, casual and direct. Something you'd send on WhatsApp or iMessage. Explains what you're working on and what you need (feedback, support, a conversation, etc.).

**Tone:** Conversational. Sounds like a real person, not a press release.

---

## Template 06 — Project Brief

**ID:** `project-brief`

**Label pattern:** "Download your project brief"

**When to surface:** when the project has enough substance to warrant a structured document. Almost always in the default six — this is the "take this somewhere and use it" artifact.

**Content shape:**
Structured markdown document:
- Project name and one-liner
- What it is (expanded)
- Current state
- What exists already
- What's missing or unclear
- Recommended next direction
- Key assumptions
- What not to do yet

**Tone:** Professional but not corporate. Readable by a non-technical person.

---

## Template 07 — Stakeholder Update

**ID:** `stakeholder-update`

**Label pattern:** "Update your [co-founder / team / manager]"
Adapted based on context clues in the input.

**When to surface:** when the input suggests there are other people involved or who need to be kept informed. Don't surface if the project appears fully solo with no stakeholders.

**Content shape:**
Short structured message (3–4 short paragraphs):
- Where we are
- What we decided / what changed
- What's happening next
- What I need from you (if anything)

**Tone:** Professional, direct. Like a good Slack update.

---

## Template 08 — Risk Summary

**ID:** `risk-summary`

**Label pattern:** "What could go wrong"

**When to surface:** when genuine risks are identifiable from the input. Never surface if risks are invented. Particularly relevant when the project has a deadline, dependency, or stated uncertainty.

**Content shape:**
2–3 specific risks (not more):
- What the risk is (one sentence)
- Why it matters (one sentence)
- What to watch for / how to mitigate (one sentence)

**Tone:** Calm and practical. Not catastrophising. Treats the user as an adult.

---

## Template 09 — Notion Brief

**ID:** `notion-brief`

**Label pattern:** "Copy as Notion page"

**When to surface:** when Notion was mentioned or detected in the user's input/confirmed tools.

**Content shape:**
Same as project brief (#06) but formatted for Notion:
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Bullet points where appropriate
- Callout block for the key decision or main risk
- Property-style summary at the top (Status, Phase, Owner, Last updated)

**Tone:** Structured and clean. Looks good in Notion without manual reformatting.

---

## Template 10 — Claude/ChatGPT Handoff

**ID:** `ai-handoff`

**Label pattern:** "Start fresh in [Claude / ChatGPT]"
Distinct from Template 03 (continue) — this is for starting a new conversation, not continuing the current one.

**When to surface:** when the user appears to want to start a structured new conversation elsewhere rather than continue the current thread.

**Content shape:**
A context-setting document for a new AI conversation:
- Full project brief (compressed)
- What's been decided
- What role to ask the AI to play
- What to work on in this new conversation

**Tone:** Structured. Reads like a project onboarding document for an AI assistant.

---

## Template 11 — What Not To Do

**ID:** `stop-list`

**Label pattern:** "What to avoid right now"

**When to surface:** when the input contains clear scope creep risks, premature decisions, or actions that would waste time given current project state. Don't surface if nothing specific to warn against is identifiable.

**Content shape:**
3–5 specific things not to do right now, each with a one-line reason why. No filler. Only genuinely applicable items.

**Tone:** Direct and protective. Feels like advice from someone who's seen this go wrong before.

---

## Template 12 — Speculative Roadmap

**ID:** `speculative-roadmap`

**Label pattern:** "Where this could go (if it works)"

**When to surface:** when the project has enough direction to extrapolate meaningfully. Label must always signal this is speculative, not a commitment.

**Content shape:**
3–4 phases beyond the current one:
- Phase name
- What it involves
- What "done" looks like
- Rough sequence dependency

Clearly prefaced with: "If the immediate priorities go well, here's a plausible longer-term direction. This is extrapolation, not a plan."

**Tone:** Optimistic but honest. Doesn't oversell.

---

## Template 13 — Project Name Ideas

**ID:** `name-ideas`

**Label pattern:** "Name ideas for this project"

**When to surface:** ONLY when no clear project name was detected in the input. If the project has a name, do not surface this.

**Content shape:**
5 name directions, each with:
- The name
- One sentence on what it communicates
- One sentence on what it doesn't capture

**Tone:** Creative but grounded. Names should actually fit the project, not be generic startup naming conventions.

---

## Template 14 — Elevator Pitch

**ID:** `elevator-pitch`

**Label pattern:** "Your elevator pitch"

**When to surface:** when the project has a clear enough direction to pitch, and the user appears to be at a stage where they'd need to explain it to a potential collaborator, investor, or partner.

**Content shape:**
2 sentences:
- What it is and who it's for
- Why now / why this matters

Plus optionally: a one-line hook version (under 10 words).

**Tone:** Confident and specific. Never vague. If the project isn't clear enough to pitch honestly, don't surface this template.

---

## Template 15 — GitHub Issue Draft

**ID:** `github-issue`

**Label pattern:** "Draft a GitHub issue"

**When to surface:** ONLY when GitHub was mentioned or detected in confirmed tools AND the recommended action is specific enough to become a ticket.

**Content shape:**
- Issue title
- Description (what and why)
- Acceptance criteria (done-when conditions)
- Labels suggestion

**Tone:** Technical and precise. Written for a developer to pick up and act on.
